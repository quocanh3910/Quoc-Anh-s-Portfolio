Key Drivers
* Operational Efficiency: Q3 2025 results show a record profit of 1,783 billion VND (2.2x YoY), validating the "Reduce Quantity – Enhance Quality" strategy.

* Grocery Segment Break-even: Bách Hóa Xanh (BHX) has achieved company-level profitability, with 2025 revenue projected to surge to 63,078 billion VND.

* Valuation Support: MWG trades at a Forward P/E significantly lower than its historical average and peers like FPT Retail (FRT), offering a margin of safety.
